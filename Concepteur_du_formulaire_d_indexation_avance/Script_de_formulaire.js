/*************************************************************************
*
* Form Script
* 
* Custom code for the form and its elements can be written in this script.
* 
* The code is defined and is being used as an Asynchronous Module 
* Definition (AMD) javascript module. Any external JS framework, libary 
* or other JS code that supports the AMD module system can be loaded 
* and used. The loading of the modules is being handled by RequireJS. 
*
* Configuring and specifying each external module can be done with the 
* require.config object of RequireJS to be used as dependencies with 
* the AMD define() function below.
* 
* For example: To include jQuery v2.2.4 the following configuration
* can be used. It will define a module named 'jquery' along with the 
* a specific URL of where it can be fetched from. 'jquery' module will
* then be available to be loaded and used as a dependency in the form 
* script module.
*
* require.config({
*     paths: {
*         react: "//unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development",
*         jquery: "//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.4/jquery",        
*     }
* });
*
* More information about RequireJS configuration can be found in its 
* official website:
* https://requirejs.org/
*
* The Form Script module will be imported and evaluated using the 
* requireJS module system each time the form will be displayed 
* at runtime.
* 
* More information on how to write AMD modules can 
* be found in the documentation of its official specification: 
* https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api
* 
* The 'it' object dependency, implements the API of the form and 
* should therefore be always included in the dependencies.
