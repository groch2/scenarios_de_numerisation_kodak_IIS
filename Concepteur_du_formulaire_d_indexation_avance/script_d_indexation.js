/**
 * Indexing Script Template
 *
 * You may either leave the methods in this template empty or remove them,
 * if you don't want to handle the specific events.
 *
 * The fieldFocusGained, fieldFocusLost, fieldChanged, fieldOcrCompleted, 
 * fieldLoad, fieldSave methods are called for
 * every field. To write specific code for a field, use it's name:
 *   if (field.name == 'FieldName') {
 *     //code here specific to field with name 'FieldName'
 *   }
 * Alternatively, you can write specific methods to handle field specific events
 * by writing methods with names <FieldName>FocusGained, <Fieldname>FocusLost,
 * <FieldName>Changed, <FieldName>OcrCompleted, <FieldName>Load, <FieldName>Save. 
 * 
 * For example, for a field with name 'Address', you can write the following specific methods:
 *  AddressFocusGained, AddressFocusLost, AddressChanged, etc...
 *  
 * Notice that if the field name contains any characters other than letters,
 * digits or underscore (_), they are replaced with an underscore. So, a field
 * whose name is "First Name" will be mapped to functions with names:
 *  First_NameFocusGained, First_NameFocusLost, First_NameChanged
 * In the case that there is a specific function for a field, the generic
 * method is not called at all for this field.
 * The field methods support special return values: see the comments before each
 * method for details.
 *
 * The standard output and error streams can be accessed thourgh the variables
 * 'out' and 'err'. For example:
 *   out.println("Hello World");
 *   err.println("This goes to standard error");
 * Normally, standard out and err are redirected to the client log file.
 * You may use the 'debug' object to direct output to the 'Debug output' window
 *
 * The following global objects are always defined:
 *   batch      (see Javadoc for com.imagetrust.tc.model.object.IBatch)
 *   job        (see Javadoc for com.imagetrust.tc.model.object.IJob)
 *   MainWindow (see Javadoc for java.awt.Window)
 *   IndexPane  (see Javadoc for com.imagetrust.tc.model.object.IIndexingContext)
 *   Engine     (see Javadoc for com.imagetrust.tc.model.object.IScript)
 *   ITUtils
 *   loggedUser (see Javadoc for com.imagetrust.tc.model.object.IUser)
 *
 *  After the preProcess method is called, these objects are also defined
 *  based on the context:
 *   document (if this script is for a Document class)
 *   folder (if this script is for a Folder class)
 *   node (always, identical to document or folder)
 *
 *  You can access the current list of fields from any method (except the
 *  load and unload) using the 'fields' property of the 'node' object.
 *  For example:
 *    node.fields['Address'].value = 'An address';
 *    node.fields['Company Name'].visible = false;
 *
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  
 *  Scripting evaluation
 *  --------------------
 *  Since scripts are attached to Document and Folder classes, they are evaluated
 *  once every time Indexing starts and when the script needs to load.
 *  It is important to remember the evaluation context to determine the scope of
 *  global variables and functions. The load() method is called exactly after
 *  the evaluation of the script.
 *  
 *  In Test/Debug mode, evaluation of the script takes place when the script is
 *  updated.
 *

 * This is a function that is called under very specific conditions, and always

 * Specifically, it is called when in an index step configuration, the 'Save method' 
 * for one (or more) fields is set to 'Script'. In those cases, it is not really possible
 * to know the actual namespace in the node's properties that a field's value is saved (since
 * the fieldSave(field) method above is free to use whatever namespace it wants).
 * 
 * If the value of the field needs to be read (in the context of an Index step), then
 * this method will be used to get the namespace to use from the node's properties.
 * If this method is not implemented or does not return a string, then the default
 * namespace 'idx' will be used. The main function that requires reading the values
 * of fields is to decide whether indexing is complete for a given index step.
 * 
 * Since this method may also be called in the server, you should make no assumptions
 * for the JavaScript scope and global objects. To be 100% safe, the implementation
 * of this method should not access any other objects other than the ones given
 * as parameters. Also, the objects in the parameters are given in a read-only context, 
 * so you should not attempt to modify any of their properties.
 * 
 * It usually makes more sense to override this method in the field in the index step
 * conf script, to make it specific to that step (although the actual step is passed
 * as the first parameter).
 * 
 * This method should return a single string, which is the namespace in the node's
 * properties for the given fields. For example:
 *   return 'index2.' + field.name;

/**
 * Called whenever the client OCR engine is queried to auto-fill an index field.
 * This method is called only on a Document Class script, because only the 
 * index fields of a Document Class can have an associated Index Zone 
 * on which OCR is performed automatically.
 * This method is called in two different cases:
 *   1. after the fieldLoad() method (if any), during initialization of the index 
 *      pane for a document, if the field is empty
 *   2. Whenever another event (like an image rotation) causes the OCR engine to 
 *      re-run.
 *
 * Do not count on this method to be called each time: the OCR engine or other internal logic
 * may decide that OCR of a field is not necessary or that cached results are enough. 
 * Instead, think of this method as a way to modify the behavior of auto-filling a field
 * with the OCR results.
 * 
 * This method is called immediately after the OCR extraction results become available
 * and before the default logic is executed (the default logic is to use the extracted
 * value with the maximum confidence and set the field value, if the field does not already
 * have a value; the field.review is set if the extraction confidence is less than
 * the minimum confidence level defined for this index zone).
 * 
 * You can arbitrarily modify the properties of the given field (e.g. value, text, review, etc)
 * to override the default behavior: in that case, the method should return 'false' to
 * suppress the default behavior.
 * 
 * Let's say that you want to prepend a specific string (e.g. 'OCR: ') to the
 * extracted value and reset the review flag in all cases. The following code
 * will do that:
 *   if (maxConfidenceData != null){
 *    field.text = 'OCR:' + maxConfidenceData.value;
 *    field.review = false;
 *    return false;
 *   }
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   field : the index field for which the ocr was performed.
 *   extractionData : a list of all the extracted data (ExtractionData objects), 
 *     from all index zones that refer to the given index field. 
 *     The ExtractionData object has the following properties:
 *       rect, value, confidence, indexZone, page.
 *   maxConfidenceExtractionData: the extracted data (Extraction object) with the 
 *     highest confidence. If the index field uses only one index zone, then the 
 *     maxConfidenceData will be equal to the only item in the extractionData list.
 * Supported return values:
 *  true: if you want the default behavior to be executed (default return value)
 *  false: if you do not want the default behavior to be executed
